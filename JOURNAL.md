## June 17-19<sup>th </sup> : Made the Top Gantory and Custom Parts
#### I explored many top gantory designs for Core-XY builds with MGN-12 and I find Core-XY Frame V2.0 matches the most with my requirements but this is not fuly compatible so i have to edit all the parts to fit on 2040 frame and also made a custom extruder holder along with some more tweaks to make the frame more stable and robust.The changes i made :
- Adapt the build to be compatible with 2040 frame
- Made a custom extruder holder
- Make parts more robust and strong
