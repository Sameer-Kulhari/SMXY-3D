##  June 12<sup>th</sup> : Project Ideation and Sketching
- Started planning the overall design and purpose of the 3D printer on paper.
- Researched core features to be included in a high-speed and professional printer.
- Noted ideas around rigidity, performance, and ease of upgrade.
- Finalized goals like: strong frame, high speed, and high print quality.

**Key Features Finalized:**
- Core-XY motion system  
- MGN12 Linear Rails  
- Klipper Compatibility  
- 310×310×310 Build Volume  
- Dual Z-Axis  
- Bowden Extruder  
- Octopus v1.1 Mainboard  
- 4040 Aluminum Frame for stability

**Time Spent: 4 Hours**

##  June 13<sup>th</sup> : Feature Research and Frame Design
I learn and study about various printer builds to get a idea on it and note some important points about the frame layout,structure and allignment So, that my printer build is properly stable and strong to withstand the demands.

- Studied best practices in frame layout and structure.
- Compared real-world printers for strength and stiffness.
- Started listing required mechanical components.

**Time Spent: 4 Hours**

##  June 14<sup>th</sup> : Finalizing Basic Components
I researched about the 3d Printers parts and there types and use cases So , I can choose the perfect and best options for my build to get more performance and quality in printing.

- Finalized most mechanical parts after researching prices, compatibility, and reviews.
- Compared 3–4 websites for sourcing.
- Shortlisted components based on quality .

**Parts Chosen:**
- 2020, 2040, 4040 Aluminum Extrusions  
- MGN12 Linear Rails  
- V6 Hotend  
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motors  
- Octopus v1.1 Mainboard  
- 8mm Lead Screws

##  June 15<sup>th</sup> : Core-XY Gantry Research
For the Core-XY build i researched about various top Gantry design which are easy to build with less parts and rigidity.Finally i found the *CoreXY Frame V2.0* the best option but it also has some flaws.

- Explored top gantry designs suitable for MGN12-based Core-XY setups.
- Found **CoreXY Frame V2.0** design as a good match.
- Identified compatibility issues and noted required customizations.

**Time Spent: 3 Hours**

##  June 16<sup>th</sup> : Customization of Gantry & Parts
After knowing about the flaws in the 3d models from *CoreXY Frame V2.0* I redesign them with keeping rigidity and compatibility with 2040 in mind.For this take proper measurements and make there proper models.

- Modified gantry design to support 2040 frame profiles.
- Designed a **custom extruder holder**.
- Enhanced structural parts for more robustness and strength.


**Time Spent: 6 Hours**

##  June 17<sup>th</sup> : Finishing Gantry Modifications
After making the top gantry parts I assembled them and check for any error in it and everything alligned perfectly.Then i make a proper assembly of the parts to see the final look. 

- Finalized tweaks to the CoreXY layout and saved edited parts.
- Verified alignment and mounting logic.

##  June 18<sup>th</sup> : CAD Part Collection
For full assembly I explored different websites and then dowload all the prebuilt CAD models for the parts to be used in the design and then make a proper folder for them.

- Searched for and imported CAD models of all standard components from GrabCAD & Thingiverse.
- Adjusted sizes and geometry where necessary.

**Time Spent: 4 Hours**

---

##  June 19<sup>th</sup> : Custom CAD Part Design
I look for all other custom parts that i need to make for assembly and after that i took the measurements and made 3d models for them.
- Modeled custom brackets, joints, and mounts using Onshape.
- Measured physical dimensions of real parts and matched CAD accordingly.

**Time Spent: 5 Hours**

---

##  June 20<sup>th</sup> : Preparing Assembly Setup
I organised all sub-assemblies and make a full assembly from it and verify the part compatibility to prevent any issues in the future during the build and designing.
- Structured sub-assemblies (gantry, base, frame, etc.) to simplify final assembly.
- Verified part compatibility across imported and custom parts.

**Time Spent: 4 Hours**

---

##  June 21<sup>st</sup> : Final Assembly in Onshape
- Assembled all parts in Onshape with proper alignment and looks.
- Focused on accurate bolt and nut placements.
- Took images and screenshots for documentation.

##  June 22<sup>nd</sup> : Web Upload and Repository Setup
- Created GitHub repository with structure:
  - `/CAD`
  - `/Images`
  - `/BOM`
  - `/README.md`
- Uploaded CAD files to **GrabCAD** and **Thangs** for open source access.

**Time Spent: 3 Hours**

---

##  June 23<sup>rd</sup> : BOM & Final Documentation
- Created a clean, organized **Bill of Materials** (CSV and Markdown).
- Documented each section in the README with:
  - Features
  - Instructions
  - Images and Renders
- Wrote a mini journal and wrapped up documentation.

**Time Spent: 3 Hours**
